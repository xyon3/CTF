# CVE-2019-14287
### October 29, 2021

I personally call this the "i'm you but +1" vulnerability

```
<username> <hostname> = (ALL, !root) /usr/bin/<command>
```

The configuration above means that "username" can perform stuff like any other user except root.

The design flaw in this configuration allows the "username" to run a command as root by crafting the user id using:

```
$ sudo -u#-1 <command>
```
